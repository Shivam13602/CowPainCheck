# v2.1 — Legacy artifacts (export)

This folder exists to keep **exported artifacts** captured from the training/evaluation workspace (`facial_pain_project_v2`).

## Contents

- `artifacts/results_v2.1/`: cross-val CSVs + plots saved during evaluation
- `artifacts/evaluation_results_v2/`: older evaluation CSV exports
- `artifacts/training_analysis/`: training summary CSV exports

These are **not the primary baselines** for the current manuscript, but they are kept for traceability.
